# frontend-challenge react.js

PURPOSE

The purpose of this challenge is to test your ability to:
- Replicate a design using html/css/react
- Create basic react components and shared components
- Work with 3rd party components (i.e. Bryntum Scheduler)
- Handle drag/drop events, object handling and user interaction


GETTING STARTED

To get started, you'll need to clone this repo to your local PC and run these files on a PHP web server. Make sure PHP is installed and you can use the following command to run the web server: "php -S localhost:8000". Once it's running, access the url with "/docs" on the end (such as http://localhost:8000/docs) as this will bypass the "Trial Expiry" limitation. Refer to the below 2 tasks for this challenge. After you have completed your work, upload it to your github account and provide us the link to the repo.


TASK 1 - Create Side Panel (UI slicing)

- Refer to "design.png" and create the side panel as react components
- Use CSS to stylise all elements exactly like the design
- Consider adding hover effects on the tasks (you determine the hover style)


TASK 2 - Implement Drag & Drop (Development)

- In the side panel you created, the user should be able to drag a task from the panel onto the scheduler board (in Bryntum these are called events)
- Refer to this example to see how the drag feature should work from a panel onto the scheduler https://www.bryntum.com/examples/scheduler/dragfromgrid/. You will also find the zipped source code files for the drag demo contained with this repo "dragfromgrid.zip" which you will need
